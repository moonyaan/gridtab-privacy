# Privacy Policy for GridTab
**Effective Date: 2025-09-02**

**Summary:** GridTab replaces your New Tab with a draggable bookmarks grid. It works offline by default; sign‑in is optional and only used for sync.

**Data We Collect**

Without sign‑in: grid layout (rows/columns), saved bookmarks (URL and title), theme, stored locally in Chrome storage.

With sign‑in: your Google account basic profile (UID, email, name, avatar) to associate your grid and sync across devices. Tokens are stored locally to authenticate with Firebase.

**How We Use Data:** to display and sync your bookmarks grid. We do not sell, rent, or use data for advertising.

**Data Sharing:** none, except trusted processors (Google/Firebase) used to provide authentication and storage.

**Storage & Retention:** local data stays on your device; synced data is stored in Firebase tied to your account and retained until you delete it or sign out. You can delete items anytime.

**Permissions:** storage (save grid state), tabs (read current tab URL/title only when you click the toolbar button), identity (optional Google sign‑in), limited host permissions (Google OAuth and Firebase endpoints).

**Security:** transport encryption (HTTPS) and access controls via your Google account.

**Children:** not directed to children under 13.

**Changes:** we may update this policy; the latest version will be posted at this URL.
